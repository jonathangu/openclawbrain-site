# OpenClawBrain Principal Operator Guide

## 1) What OpenClawBrain is
OpenClawBrain is the long-term memory layer for OpenClaw agents: it builds a learned graph from your workspace (`~/.openclaw/workspace`) plus session feedback (`~/.openclaw/agents/<agent>/sessions`), then serves fast query/learn operations from a persistent daemon state file (`~/.openclawbrain/<agent>/state.json`).

## 2) Turn brain ON
Canonical run command:

```bash
openclawbrain serve --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json
```

What `serve` does:
- Starts the long-lived `openclawbrain daemon` worker.
- Exposes a Unix socket at `~/.openclawbrain/main/daemon.sock` (for agent `main`).
- Keeps the daemon hot in memory and restarts it if needed.

## 3) Confirm it's ON

```bash
openclawbrain status --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json
ls -l ~/.openclawbrain/main/daemon.sock
```

Healthy signal:
- `status` shows `Daemon: running ~/.openclawbrain/main/daemon.sock`
- `daemon.sock` exists as a Unix socket (`-S` / `srw...`).

## 4) Safe rebuild paths

### quick cutover
Use when you need improvements now and can defer full replay/harvest.

```bash
openclawbrain replay \
  --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json \
  --sessions ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions \
  --fast-learning \
  --stop-after-fast-learning \
  --resume \
  --checkpoint ~/.openclawbrain/main/replay_checkpoint.json
```

Then keep serving from the daemon state.

### no-drama rebuild_then_cutover
Use when you need single-writer safety during rebuild and minimal cutover downtime.

```bash
examples/ops/rebuild_then_cutover.sh main ~/.openclaw/workspace \
  ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions
```

This rebuilds into a fresh directory, verifies it, stops daemon briefly at cutover, swaps dirs atomically, then restarts.

### full-learning guidance + when to schedule it
Use full-learning (`--full-learning`) off-peak (nightly/low traffic, and after large session growth or major workspace changes).  
Single-writer rule still applies: either run full-learning on a NEW state before cutover, or stop daemon writes before replaying LIVE.

## 5) Checkpoints & resume
Default checkpoint path is next to state: `~/.openclawbrain/main/replay_checkpoint.json`.

Inspect checkpoint state (recommended):

```bash
openclawbrain replay \
  --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json \
  --show-checkpoint \
  --resume
```

Machine-readable checkpoint status:

```bash
openclawbrain replay \
  --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json \
  --show-checkpoint \
  --resume \
  --json
```

Direct file inspection is still useful for debugging:

```bash
jq . ~/.openclawbrain/main/replay_checkpoint.json
```

Flag meanings:
- `--checkpoint <path>`: checkpoint file location.
- `--resume`: continue from saved per-session line offsets.
- `--ignore-checkpoint`: start from scratch even if checkpoint exists.
- `--checkpoint-every-seconds N`: periodic time-based checkpointing.
- `--checkpoint-every N`: checkpoint every N replay windows/merge batches.
- `--stop-after-fast-learning`: end after fast-learning phase (for quick cutover).

## 6) Progress: expected output by phase
- Fast-learning prints progress and completes with `Completed fast-learning; stopped before replay/harvest.` when `--stop-after-fast-learning` is set.
- Replay emits a progress heartbeat every 30 seconds by default; add `--progress-every N` for per-item cadence.
- Use `--quiet` to suppress replay banners/progress when scripting.
- Replay phase: stderr shows `Loaded <N> interactions from session files`; with `--progress-every`, shows `[replay] <done>/<total> (<pct>%)`.
- Replay completion: `Replayed <n>/<total> queries, <m> cross-file edges created`
- Full-learning completion (`--full-learning`): final line includes harvest summary, e.g. `harvest: tasks=<k>, damped_edges=<x>`.

## 7) Concurrency rules (single writer)
Only one process should write a given `state.json` at a time.

Writers include:
- daemon learning/injection flows
- `openclawbrain replay`
- maintenance/harvest operations that persist state

If violated, writes can clobber each other (lost updates, split/corrupted operational state, stale checkpoints).  
OpenClawBrain enforces this with `state.json.lock` next to your state file.

If a lock is active and you still need to proceed, override only when you are certain there is no conflicting writer:
- `--force`
- `OPENCLAWBRAIN_STATE_LOCK_FORCE=1`

Recommended production path: use `examples/ops/rebuild_then_cutover.sh` so rebuild/replay happens on a fresh state and cutover is atomic.

## 8) Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Commands |
|---|---|---|
| `status` says `Daemon: not running` | service not started, crashed, or wrong state path | `openclawbrain serve --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json` then `openclawbrain status --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json` |
| `daemon.sock` missing | service never started or wrong agent/state directory | `ls -la ~/.openclawbrain/main` and restart `openclawbrain serve` with the same `--state` |
| Replay fails with lock/single-writer message | another process holds `state.json.lock` | stop the other writer, use `examples/ops/rebuild_then_cutover.sh ...`, or expert override with `--force` / `OPENCLAWBRAIN_STATE_LOCK_FORCE=1` |
| Replay restarts from old work | checkpoint not used, wrong path, or intentionally ignored | run with `--resume --checkpoint ~/.openclawbrain/main/replay_checkpoint.json`; inspect with `openclawbrain replay --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json --show-checkpoint --resume` |
| `LLM required for fast-learning` | no OpenAI client/key configured for fast-learning mining | set `OPENAI_API_KEY` or run `--edges-only` replay path |
| CLI says invalid sessions path | wrong sessions directory/file path | `ls -la ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions` and pass existing dir/files to `--sessions` |
